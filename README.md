# ShinyValidator
Template GUI to validate datasets. Fork this template to customize for your project needs,
and use as an app locally or deploy via the `rsconnect` package.

## Components of ShinyValidator

* [ui.R and server.R - The "look" of the GUI](#uir-and-serverr---the-look-of-the-gui)
* [common.R - Function specifications](#commonr---validators-functions)
* [data_specifications and yaml files](#data_specifications-and-yaml-files)

## Dependencies

The following R packages are required to run the scripts in this repo: `tidyverse`, `shiny`, `shinythemes`, and `yaml`. To deploy the app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) instead of running it locally, you will also need `rsconnect`.
